Inversion Background
- Short and sweet
	An inversion is a section of a chromosome where all the genes have been flipped
- Long and bitter
	Inversions were popular to look at in the 1920s/30s looking at full chromosomes
	Guessed that they would have an effect on recombination!! Turned out to be right
	Rebirth of interest since the late 2000s, especially with NGS
	In 2005 found 1500 inversions! (In the 20s/30s could only identify ~9
- How/why do they evolve?
	If an inverted chromosomes has (almost) the same genetic information as an inverted 	one, what could cause it to spread through a population?
	Probably local adaptation
- Why is modelling critical?
- What we hope to find

SLiM Background
- The necessity for SLiM
- One big loop

Our model
- Generic overview of the model
- What this model is NOT doing
- Why how we code recombination is important
- How we alter recombination/our recombination function
(Aside) A sense of scale
