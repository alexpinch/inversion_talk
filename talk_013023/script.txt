"tell them what you're going to tell them, tell them, tell them what you just told them"

What I'm going to tell them:
------------
1) Inversion background:
I'm going to tell you that it's puzzling why inversions maintain themselves in populations, and that trapped local adaptive genes is a good theory for why inversions persist in populations. Our hypothesis is that deleterial load, 

2) My project background:
I'm going to tell you that by modelling a locally adaptive inversion across subpopulations over a period of 100k generations, we could see deleterial load around the inversion accumulate to the point where it tips the balance of the potential benefit of the inversion.

3) SLiM and my recombination function:
I'm going to tell you why SLiM was created, why its necessary to use it for this kind of investigation, and why the devil is in the details (especially for coding recombination)

4) Results/roadblocks:
I'm going to tell you some of my preliminary results, why they were unexpected, and what I'm doing about it now.

Telling them:
-------------
1) Inversion background:
Inversions first described 100 years ago, and the resurgence since sequence only started in the last 15 years or so (resurgence of interest partially mediated by the discovery of many more, on the order of 1000s in an individual, when thought to be around 9 in Drosophila)

2) My project background:
By making a SLiM model that introduces an inversion, preventing recombination and giving inversion-carrying individuals a blanket fitness increase/decrease depending on which population they are from, we can make it output fitness values, number of deleterious mutations, and it's inversion genotype. Others have modelled the long-term fate of inversions, and we've heavily modified Berdan's recombination to be our own. However, there's lots of ways to model an inversion. We have scaled down from the wild significantly, a bit less than Berdan. The idea is that when scaled down, it can/and should

3) SLiM and my recombination function:
Models have been a mainstay in population genetics for a while, and with new programs like SLiM, its easier to develop intricate forward-simulations that can look at the long-term fate of inversions like this.
